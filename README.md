# Turbine Inspection
Link: http://54.202.239.71/main.php

Hosted on Amazon Web Services and using XAMPP, coded in PHP, rendered with HTML and styled with CSS. 
Database uses MySQL on phpMyAdmin. 
Ajax call used to get the table of inspection results.

A Future idea could be the ability to add notes to each of the inspection items that will be stored in the database with the inspection items.

Notes I made before Implementation: 
Set up AWS instance with PHPMyAdmin for a MySQL database. 
Program Logic in PHP for the inspection data. 
Link PHP with the database. 
Output result to HMTL. 
Make a readable and clear UP. 
Implement an Ajax call.
