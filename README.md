# TurbineInspection
Link: http://54.202.239.71/main.php

Hosted on Amazon Web Services and using XAMPP, coded in php, rendered with html and styled with css
Database uses MySQL on phpMyAdmin.
Ajax call used to get table of inspection results.

Future idea could be the ability to add notes to each of the inspection item that will be stored in the database with the inspection items.

Notes I made before Implementation:
Set up aws instance with phpmyadmin for a mySQL database.
Program Logic in php for the inspection data.
Link php with the database
Output result to HMTL
Make a readable and clear UP.
Implement an Ajax call.
